<h2>Ticket System</h2>

This is a ticket system I am creating to showcase at work.

It currently is using 

Ruby -v 2.3

Rails -v 5.0


This is the second time i had to create this. The first time it  could not find activesupport 5.0

No idea what the problem was, but recreating the project worked.
